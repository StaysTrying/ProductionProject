# ProductionProject
Hello! My name is Tyler Krawec, the author of this program, and I would like to thank you for checking out my repository. <br />
This is a project that I coded while taking Object Oriented Programming and design my junior year of college at Florida Gulf Coast University. <br />
It takes shape as a graphical user interface itegrated with a database that is coded in Java, JavaFX, and SQL.<br />
The goal of this project is to gain a greater understanding of object oriented programming and how it can be applied to a real world scenario. <br />
ProductionProject is a program that allows users to create and produce a digital product and save its information to a database where it can later be retrieved from.<br />
This program also has apassword protected login screen so that only registered users with an account may interact with, to improve the security of my program. <br />
I took extra time to ensure that my progam is asthetically pleasing, and required actions are explained to the user.<br />

## Demonstration
This is a video that illustrates my programs functionality. <br />
